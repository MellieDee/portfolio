## Additional Notes
***
### CSS organization in the order
Design for 320px screen first. MQ increase in screen size.

Generally speaking it is organized as follows however, because of cosolidation, some sections are combined:
- Global
- Reset
- Uiversal/Utility
- Font/Headers
- Images
- Elements/Selectors/Classes in HTML order (mostly -see note above)
- Media Queries
- Generally, subgroups appear in their in HTML order

#### Other things I was exploring
***

  - accent-color2: rgba(150, 7, 88, 1.0); #960758
  - CSS Grid
  - still woking on a style-guide of sorts for creating consistency in class creation
  -- simiarly still devising what my preferred order of CSS selectors is
